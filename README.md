   ðŸ’¬ Sentiment Analysis

Model Selection: sppm/cric-tweets-sentiment-analysis
    
We selected the sppm/cric-tweets-sentiment-analysis model, which is a fine-tuned version of cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest. This model has been trained on 3,000 pre-match cricket tweets, making it highly specialized for analyzing sentiments in the context of cricket-related content.
    
Given its training data, this model is expected to perform with high accuracy for determining the sentiment of cricket commentaries, including tweets and other textual  inputs.
    
By leveraging this domain-specific model, we aim to achieve robust sentiment analysis tailored to the nuances of cricket commentary, ensuring more reliable insights    compared to general-purpose sentiment models.
